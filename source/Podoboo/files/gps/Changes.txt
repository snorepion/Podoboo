Updates:
 3/21/2017 (V1.2.31) (TheBiob)
  - Added yet another overlooked offset (WallBody) and changed Wallrun to WallFeet
     difference is that WallFeet runs when wallrunning on the block and WallBody runs when touching a block while wallrunning.

 3/11/2017 (V1.2.3) (TheBiob)
  - Added a new header (db $37) which allows a block to use the new Wallrun offset

 2/27/2017 (V1.2.2) (GreenHammerBro)
  - Was removed because the moderator would like the wallrun offset to be optional.

 2/8/2017 (V1.2.1) (GreenHammerBro)
  - Fix a bug where spriteH may not execute block codes when embedded deeply in the block. This can be
    proven by having a block act like $130 via Lunar magic, but have spriteH and spriteV both run this code:
     ;----code----;
      LDY #$00
      LDA #$25
      STA $1693
     ;----end_code----;
    which causes the sprites (mostly dropped sprites, like shells) to be pushed out. Therefore, the block
    partially behaves $025. This works the other way around too: $025 by Lunar Magic, behaves $130 with
    block codes and the blocks fail to push sprites outward.

  - Added another block offset: MarioWallRun.
