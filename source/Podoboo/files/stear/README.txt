STEAR is a program that can be used to remap virtually any sprite tile in Super Mario World.

Usage is relatively simple: load your ROM, select the sprite you want to edit in Sprite selection, then edit each individual tile by choosing it in Properties.  To change a tile, simply click on the tile you want to use in the Graphics section.

Note that certain sprites can only have tiles on either the first or second page, which means that their graphics are limited to only using one half of the available space.  This is somewhat rare, however.

Also note that even if a tile gives you the option to edit its palette or x and y flip, this may not always actually change in the game, due to how Super Mario World hardcodes various values.

In addition, this program cannot change how sprites look in Lunar Magic.  You must do that yourself; see the readme for more information on that if necessary.

Finally, in the very rare chance that this program crashes your game, simply use xkasanti with spriteremap.asm and everything will be okay.  Then please send me a bug report so I can find out what went wrong.

Happy remapping!
