 1. Introduction
______________________________________________________________________


 Sniff is a compressed data scanning program intended for use with the
 Lunar Compress DLL module.  It uses a brute force method to try and 
 locate the offsets of all compressed data in a file using a specified
 format, and records that information to a log file (and optionally
 decompresses the data it finds).

 What it will NOT do is magically figure out a new format that Lunar
 Compress doesn't support, although it can be useful in determining
 if a particular game uses a specific format that was used in another
 game.

 Of course, using a brute force method like this tends to be rather
 messy and gives an awful lot of false readings depending on the format
 and how discriminating the decompression routines were made.  Plus
 any format that does not have a terminating sequence and instead
 requires you to know the size of the decompressed data in advance
 cannot be brute forced using this program (ie. formats like LC_RLE2
 and LC_RLE3).

 To help reduce the number of false matches, a few basic filters have
 been included (see example section for descriptions).  The program
 will also identify areas where there are large groups of consecutive
 matches in the log file, which usually indicate a high probability
 of true matches.  Just search for the word "group" in the log file
 to find these.

 Ultimately though, nothing can really beat just looking through an
 ASM trace and tracking down the pointer tables manually.  But if
 you don't have the skill or time for that, or you just want a head
 start in finding offsets to look for, sniff.exe can usually make 
 life a little bit easier.  ^^

 2. What's New
______________________________________________________________________


Version 1.13 October 12, 2009

-minor update to "wait for click to close" code.


Version 1.12 December 25, 2002

-Added the option of using LC version 1.32's ability to decompress
 from RAM.  This can significantly increase the speed of data scanning
 on computers with slower hard drives.


Version 1.10 July 20, 2002

-First Public Release.

 3. Usage and Examples
______________________________________________________________________

 Usage is as follows:
  sniff.exe FileToScan OffsetToStart OffsetToEnd Flags Format Format2

 The file log.txt will automatically be generated, which contains
 more information than what appears in the window.  It will usually
 take several minutes to scan an entire ROM, depending on the format
 and the size of the ROM, plus how fast your computer is.

 FileToScan:     The ROM or file to scan.
 OffsetToStart:  Hex address to start scanning.
 OffsetToEnd:    Hex address to stop scanning.  If you want to scan 
                 the whole file, you can just put a really high number
                 and the program will automatically change it to match
                 the actual file size.
 Flags:          Hex value that has several uses (see below).
 Format:         Decimal value of compression format to use (see
                 LunarDLL.h and LunarDLL.def).
 Format2:        Decimal value of Format2 variable for decompression - 
                 rarely used, just put zero unless otherwise specified
                 (see LunarDLL.h and LunarDLL.def).


 Bit Flags Available: 0000resc ffffffff
  r:        Load the entire file into RAM for scanning.  This can
            increase the speed a fair amount.
  e:        Don't exclude matched areas from further scanning (1=enable).
            If you enable this, all offsets will be scanned regardless
            of whether or not part of the data was already matched to
            a compressed structure.  Not really recommended.
  s:        Dump all decompressed data to individual files (1=enable).
  c:        Dump all decompressed data to a single Combo File (1=enable).
  ffffffff: Filter to use.  These are predefined in the sniff.cpp file,
            but you can modify the source to add your own if you want.  
            Usually 0 is good enough.  The filters available are:

            0 : Decompressed size must be multiple of 0x10 and >= 0x80,
                compressed size must be >= 0x40,
                compressed size must be < decompressed size.
            1 : Decompressed size must be multiple of 0x10 and >= 0x100,
                compressed size must be >= 0x80,
                compressed size must be < decompressed size.
            2 : Decompressed size must be multiple of 0x10 and >= 0x200,
                compressed size must be >= 0x100,
                compressed size must be < decompressed size.
            3 : Decompressed size must be multiple of 0x10.

            4 : Decompressed size must be even and >= 0x80,
                compressed size must be >= 0x40,
                compressed size must be < decompressed size.
            5 : Decompressed size must be even and >= 0x100,
                compressed size must be >= 0x80,
                compressed size must be < decompressed size.
            6 : Decompressed size must be even and >= 0x200,
                compressed size must be >= 0x100,
                compressed size must be < decompressed size.
            7 : Decompressed size must be even.

            8 : Decompressed size must  >= 0x80,
                compressed size must be >= 0x40,
                compressed size must be < decompressed size.
            9 : Decompressed size must  >= 0x100,
                compressed size must be >= 0x80,
                compressed size must be < decompressed size.
            A : Decompressed size must  >= 0x200,
                compressed size must be >= 0x100,
                compressed size must be < decompressed size.

            B : Decompressed size must be multiple of 0x10 and >= 0x80,
                compressed size must be >= 0x40,
                compressed size must be < decompressed size,
                size != 0x10000.
            C : Decompressed size must be multiple of 0x10,
                size != 0x10000.

            D : Decompressed size must be even and >= 0x80,
                compressed size must be >= 0x40,
                compressed size must be < decompressed size,
                size != 0x10000.
            E : Decompressed size must be even,
                size != 0x10000.

            F : No restrictions (not recommended).



 -->Scan for data in Super Mario World using filter 2, dump
    to combo file (most of the graphics will be 3bpp).
 sniff.exe marioworld.smc 200 FF0000 102 1 0

 -->Scan for data in Super Mario World 2 using filter 0, dump
    to combo file AND individual files.
 sniff.exe marioworld2.smc 200 FF0000 300 1 0

 -->Scan for data in Mario RPG using filter 0, dump to
    multiple individual files (we start at 0 since this ROM
    usually doesn't have a header).
 sniff.exe mariorpg.smc 0 FF0000 200 3 0

 -->Same examples as above, but load into RAM for faster processing.
 sniff.exe marioworld.smc 200 FF0000 902 1 0
 sniff.exe marioworld2.smc 200 FF0000 B00 1 0
 sniff.exe mariorpg.smc 0 FF0000 A00 3 0
